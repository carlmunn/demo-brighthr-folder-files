# BrightHR Files and Folders Demo

## By Carl Munn

*TODO: Complete the README.md*

Notes
- Templates off Vite
- TypeScript
- Using Git
- Orders/Filters folders/files
- Open and close folders via details/summary HTML tags
- Testing with vitest, msw (http mocking)
- Using path aliases for imports
- I've used the term "Node" to represent file and folders. Since "node" represents a item in a tree structure and file systems generally are setup like this.
